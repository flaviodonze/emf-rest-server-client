= Sample EMF REST server-client application 

A sample server client application which sends and receives link:https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/[EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework)] objects using JAX-RS.
The server is a link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] application which publishes link:https://cxf.apache.org/[Apache CXF] remote services.
The client demonstrates a very simple application which communicates with the server using link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client[Rest Client for MicroProfile].

The link:https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/[EMF] objects are serialized to JSON using https://github.com/flaviodonze/emfjson-jackson.
